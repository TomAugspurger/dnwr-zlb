Version control for my second-year paper.

There are two main topics in this repo: data wrangling and model building.
They are broken into the main subdirectories `data_wrangling` and `model`.
Each of those subdirectories has its own readme file.

The writing subdirectory also contains the `TeX` file used to set the paper, if for whatever reason you're interested.

The easies way to reproduce the paper is the `setup.py` file.
Either [download a zip](https://github.com/TomAugspurger/dnwr-zlb/archive/master.zip) file of the repo,
or clone the repository with

```git
git clone https://github.com/tomAugspurger/dnwr-zlb
```

Unzip the file or cd into the repository and run `python setup.py install`.
